Climatic niche shifts are generally thought to be rare among invaders. Using a novel species distribution model (SDM), Gaussian random fields (GRF) I investigated niche shifts and niche overlap in Avena barbata, an annual, invasive grass that has colonized all five Mediterranean climate regions. I constrained my investigation to two of these regions, the state California (where it is invasive), and the Iberian Peninsula (where Californian populations are thought to have originated). Occurrence data was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and data from our own Californian re-survey in 2010. I examined between 11-12 climatic variables and one edaphic variable in modeling the niche of A. barbata using three different spatial sampling schemes to account for spatial bias in occurrence data. Different models were trained on subsets of data in both ranges and then used to predict probability of presence in both ranges, and isolate environmental variables that were important in predicting presence. I also used a two-factor MANOVA and linear discriminant functions to assess niche shifts and overlap in A. barbata. Overall, I found that models predicting to the opposite range had a large amount of uncertainty associated with them, MANOVAs showed significant difference between means of environmental variables in both ranges predicting presence and absence, and linear discriminant functions showed little overlap between geographic ranges. I interpreted this as evidence of a possible niche shift between Iberia and California, which may suggest that A. barbata is undergoing evolutionary change.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe frequency of occurrence of climatic niche shifts during or throughout biological invasions is unclear. At least one review proposes that niche shifts are the exception as opposed to the rule (Guisan et al., 2014). Climatic niche overlap and conservatism may emerge as the most persistent findings because characterizations of the home and invaded niches focus mainly on climatic factors (precipitation and temperature). Generally, there can be fair amount of climatic overlap for different geographic regions, and particularly Mediterranean climates (Ackerly, 2009), and even more expansive geographic regions. For example, a meta-analysis of 50 Holarctic terrestrial invasive plants found that 80% of these have substantial niche overlap and thus niche stability when compared to their home range (Petitpierre et al., 2012; Guisan et al., 2014). Niche conservatism or niche stability occurs when a species in one geographic region moves (sometimes thousands of kilometers) to another geographic region, but continues to occupy the same niche or environmental conditions as it did in its geographic place of origin, in contrast, a complete niche shift is when a species either occupies the same or different geographic space, but shifts its environment or its niche (Guisan et al., 2014). \nThe main objective of species distribution models (SDMs) is the prediction of presence and absence of one or many species given a set of environmental conditions.  In doing so, these models characterize - however imperfectly - the niche (Hutchinson, 1959). SDMs have been used to highlight niche changes or overlaps in species distributions/niches at different stages of colonization or invasion of new ranges (Václavík & Meentemeyer, 2011), predict new potential niches with respect to climate change (Pearman et al., 2008), and errors produced from SDMs may be informative as to whether the species has evolved or undergone a niche shift (Fitzpatrick et al., 2007).\n\n Ecological studies using SDMs in the study of invasions or range expansions, may come to a crossroads with evolution, and either directly or indirectly address the question of local adaptation to a new niche, in that the invaders would experience low fitness back in their home range (Godsoe et al., 2009; Yoder et al., 2014). The process of local adaptation and divergent selection would inherently imply a species has undergone a niche shift, where certain genotypes of a species have higher or lower fitness in different environments. Niche shifts do not necessarily indicate adaptation, as a species may have always possessed the genetic resources or plasticity for a particular trait such as flowering time (Levin, 2009), but merely not had the opportunity for transplant to a new niche. There may also be eco-evolutionary dynamics, where release from ecological competitors (release from selection) affects the amount of genetic variation available in the population for future generations (Emery & Ackerly, 2014).\n \nInvasive populations often suffer founder effects and the loss of adaptive (as opposed to neutral) genetic variation due to genetic bottlenecks relative to native populations. As such an invasion could result in four possibilities with respect to niche occupancy. First, the newly invaded niche may be home to a subset of genetic variation (niche contraction) that exists in the home range. Second, the newly invaded niche may be broader than the old niche (niche expansion). Third, there could also be some limited overlap between niches, but a niche shift occurs in the new habitat. Finally, there is also the possibility that there has been no niche shift, as environmental variables in either region show strong overlap with each other. \nAvena barbata Pott ex Link is an annual grass that is invasive to California, and highly selfing. Following colonization in California, it was observed that there were few sets of monomorphic allozyme genotypes present and few recombinants (Clegg & Allard, 1972; Allard et al., 1972; Hamrick & Allard, 1975). It was further demonstrated that these allozyme genotypes were composed of a reduced subset of alleles of those found in Iberia – their suspected place of origin (Garcia et al., 1989). These observations suggest that introduced populations of A. barbata to California experienced a bottleneck and lost genetic variation during colonization. Further, it was observed that A. barbata individuals in California occupy populous annual stands unlike the small patches of ruderal stands it forms in its Iberian home range (Jackson, 1985), which may be indicative of a niche shift.\nIf adaptive genetic variation were lost during a or repeated bottleneck(s), then this leads to the prediction that individuals are restricted in occupying the full breadth of the niche occupied by their Spanish ancestors, i.e. SDMs trained in Iberia would over-predict the niche in California. But if, on the other hand, multiple introductions have occurred in California (Crosby et al. 2014 Ch.2), and these introductions have recombined (Ch.4) – the resultant new combinations might allow for niche overlap with Iberia, and possibly a niche shift if the invaders have evolved since being introduced to California. If this were the scenario, than models trained in Iberia would under-predict the niche. \nIn my study I sought to characterize the amount of niche overlap and niche shifts between invasive populations of A. barbata and native Iberian populations, in doing so, I also characterize the niche in both ranges. I apply a new method of SDM, using Gaussian random fields (GRF) (Golding, 2013), which is one of the only methods that deals well with “presence-only” data. I sought to characterize the niche in Spain, using a GRF model, and then predict the probability of presence in California using this model. I then repeated the process of modeling the niche in California and used this model to predict the probability of presence in Iberia. \n\n\n```{r, echo false}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
